## Example Request

## Example Response
## Note

The response is a JSON object containing the key status, which might be success, partial, or fail.

If the status is success, there will be a count key with an int value of the count for the specified query. If the status is fail, there will be an error key with a string value and a HTTP status code.

If the status is partial, the query has not finished processing in our system. In the response, you will receive a req\_id key with a long int value that you will use to poll for the result. After the query is completed, you will either receive a success response with the count if the query was successful, or a fail response with an error string and a HTTP status code. Please wait 30 seconds between polling requests.

Here is an example response for a partial status.





































































After getting the req\_id, you will poll the endpoint below and provide the value of req\_id as a query parameter.
